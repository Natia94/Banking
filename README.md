### Banking Transactions

+  My project is to make a program of a bank account with two subclasses: checking and saving.

+  Implemeted Cumstomer account and then accouts for Adult, Senior and Student which <b> extends </b> the customer account. 

+  Test program that creates objects of CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount(bank()). Ask the user to deposit and withdraw money  from the accounts.
